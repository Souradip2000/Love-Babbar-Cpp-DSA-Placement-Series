every variable name is stored symbol table.
it stores the names and maps it to the address of the memory block to the corresponding variable

Address of Operator - &
gives the address of the variable
address is stored in hexadecimal format

Pointer - int *ptr = &i
always initialise a pointer as soon as it is declared; otherwise it will be a very bad practise as the pointer type variable will have a garbage memory address
here prt and i will point to the same block of memory

* operator : derefernceing operator

size of any pointer will be 8 because it stores an address; might be it depends on compiler

int *p = 0;    assigns null value
if we try and access thiis pointer, it will give segmentation fault

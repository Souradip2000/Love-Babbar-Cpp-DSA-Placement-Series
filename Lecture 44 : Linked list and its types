Linked list is a type of DS that is a collection of nodes.

Adv:
- dynamic ds : grow and shrink in runtime
- easy insertion and deletion : in arrays we would have to shift all the elements; we don't need to do it in ll

types:
1. singly ll
2. doubly ll
3. circular ll
4. circular doubly ll


// create a node in a linked list
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Node{
    public:
       int data;
       Node *next;
       
       Node(int data){
           this->data=data;
           this->next=NULL;
       }
};

int main(){
    Node *n1 = new Node(10);
    cout<<n1->data<<endl;
    cout<<n1->next<<endl;
    return 0;
}

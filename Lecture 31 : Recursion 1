What is recursion?
A : When a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
    directly - the function calls itself within its body only
    indirectly - the function calls another function that calls the first function within its body

If a big and complex problem's solution depends on a smaller problem of the same type, then we use recursion.

Base case                            Recursive relation                          Processing

If there's no base case, recursive function calls stack up until stack is overflowed and it gives segmentation fault. 
Return statement is compulsory in base case.









Two types of Recursion:   In tail recursion recursive relation comes after the processing part and the other way round in the second one.

Type 1: Tail Recursion

function(){
   base case;
   processing;
   recursive relation;
}

Type 2 : Head Recursion

function(){
   base case;
   recursive relation;
   processing;
}


Using head recursion or tail recursion will change the order in which we print things( processing is done ) during the recursion.

define keyword - used to define macro variables

#include<iostream> - these are preprocessor directives
preprocessor directives are declared using '#'
these are instructions that are referred to before the code is compied

#include<iostream> --> means the iostream code is copied into your code and referred to whenever required during execution of your code

suppose we have written a code over 3 years that has used the value of pi=3.14 in 1000 places.
now the value needs to be changed.
it will be inefficienct to change it in every place.

optimised apporach will be to create a variable named pi=3.14 and use it.
we can just change the variable value when reqd.

the problem here is;
  -   the variable will take up space which will hamper performance ( very little but >0)
  -   someone mistakenly changes the value of the variable within the program

Solution:

#define PI 3.14
We declare a macro 

what is a macro?
Ans :  It is a piece of code in a program that is replaced by value of macro.

BTS : before compilation, all the places where macro has been used in the program, it will be replaced with the value of macro i.e. 3.14

Advantages :
   -   no memory used as macro is not a variable that has been defined; it is only a piece of code that gets replaced with its value before compile time
   -   the value can't be changed during the program; no possibility of error

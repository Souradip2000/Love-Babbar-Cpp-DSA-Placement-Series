arr will always print the address until we write arr[index].

arr = arr + 1;    --> this cannot be done as we cannot update values in the symbol table
int *ptr = &i;
ptr = ptr + 1;    --> this can be done as here we are just increasing the value of the pointer
                      just like we change the value of a variable
                      and not changing the address of the memory block that is named ptr in the symbol table

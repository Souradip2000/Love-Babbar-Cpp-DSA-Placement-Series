OOP - relates code to real life through objects
this increases readability, managability and extensibility of the code we write

readability         -         code that clearly communicates its intent to the reader
managability        -         how easily and efficiently a software can be monitored and maintained to keep the system performing, secure and running smoothly
extensibility       -         the ability of the software system to allow and accept the significant extension of its capabilities without major rewriting of code or changes in its basic architecture

class - user defined data type
object - instance of class

object:  1. properties (data members)
         2. behaviour  (functions)

If the class has no data members and an object has been created of this class, then the size of the object will be 1 byte.

#include "Hero.cpp"
class has been declared in a different file, which we will be using in the current file

Access data members using '.' dot operator 

By default, access modifiers in a class are private
Use getters and setters to access private data members in a class.
Getter and setter can be used to implement password as to who all can get or set the values.

Access modifiers:
-         public : can be accessed anywhere, outside or inside the class
-         private : can be accessed only inside the class
-         protected : 

If we use : sizeof(Hero); --> 8 because of padding and greedly alignment

Static and Dynamic allocation of memory for object of class:
class Hero{
}
int main(){
   // static allocation of memory
         Hero a;
   // dynamic allocation of memory
         Hero *a = new Hero;
   // to access data members of dynamically allocated object memory:
         cout<< (*b).getHealth();
   [ use the dereference operator ]
         cout<< b->getHealth();
}

If the object has been dynamically allocated, then we can use the arrow -> operator on the pointer to the object 
to access one of the data members or member functions.
Other way is to dereference using * and then use the dot (.) operator.




Constructors:
 - It is invoked at the time of object creation.
whenever we declare
Hero ramesh;
a function call takes place ramesh.Hero();

This is called the default constructor:

Default constructors : 
         -  invoked at the time of object creation
         -  has no return type
         - dosen't require any parameters
This will be invoked irrespective of static or dynamic allocation of memory.

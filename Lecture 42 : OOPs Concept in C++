OOP - relates code to real life through objects
this increases readability, managability and extensibility of the code we write

readability         -         code that clearly communicates its intent to the reader
managability        -         how easily and efficiently a software can be monitored and maintained to keep the system performing, secure and running smoothly
extensibility       -         the ability of the software system to allow and accept the significant extension of its capabilities without major rewriting of code or changes in its basic architecture

class - user defined data type
object - instance of class

object:  1. properties (data members)
         2. behaviour  (functions)

If the class has no data members and an object has been created of this class, then the size of the object will be 1 byte.

Access data members using '.' dot operator 

By default, access modifiers in a class is private
